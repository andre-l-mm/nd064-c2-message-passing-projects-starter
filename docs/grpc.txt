GRPC Locations API instructions:

1. A test script is provided which creates a sample location using the grpc endpoint. Run the following to create a single location and derive new connections:

cd modules/apis/locations-grpc
python create_test_location.py

2. The GRPC api requires the same fields as the REST version (POST /locations). Also provided sample for that in the Postman scripts.

3. The REST api is only provided as additional option to create locations but as per design, the goal would be to use the GRPC version for better performance.
